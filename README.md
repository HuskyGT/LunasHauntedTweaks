Why did you create your own fork? Pull request maybe?

Originally, Haunted Tweaks was meant to co-exist with HMM and allow players to choose between the two based on their preferences. Nowadays though, HMM is broken and is likely never going to get an update again since Haunted has told me that the mod is no longer maintained.
Essentially, Haunted Tweaks going forward is going to be the "new Haunted Mod Menu" since players no longer have two choices to make based on their personal preferences.
