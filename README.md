- More soon probably :tm:

# FAQ:
Why did you create your own fork? Pull request maybe?

I think the changes I've made to the mod don't align with Haunted's views for the original project. Luna's Haunted Tweaks is meant to change somewhat minor things about the mod in ways that I believe would not be part of the original project, so I forked it and released it under the same MIT license that the original mod is under so people with preferences like mine can use this instead.
